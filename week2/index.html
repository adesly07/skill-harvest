      <div align="justify"> With the advancement of technology, the world is evolving toward the usage and application of technology in every aspect of life. One of these technologies turns out to be electronic voting (also known as E-voting, Online Voting, and Internet Voting) to support voting conventions by offering a remote mechanism that enables voters to vote at their convenience. The education sector – students’ unionism is one of the major areas that are affected most by the effects of COVID-19 and the aftermath of the lockdown deprived Students’ Union of conducting elections due to COVID-19 norms governing social gatherings. In a quest to eradicate various forms of hindrances, violence, malpractices, rigging, vote-counting, and results being tampered during student elections, an Internet voting system is developed. The main objective of this study is to create, develop, and implement an easy-to-use, user-friendly, and interactive internet-based student voting system for the Department of Data and Information Science, Faculty of Multi-Disciplinary Studies, University of Ibadan.</div></td>
